There's a whole world of small, useful websites out there that do one simple task perfectly. I've always wondered how they were made! Today, while learning the basics of DOM (Document Object Model), I built a simple click counter website - my first website using JavaScript!

Here's what it can do:
Count up by clicking the "ADD" button.
Subtract by clicking the "SUBTRACT" button.
Save the count history by clicking the "SAVE" button, which can be cleared by clicking "Clear History".
